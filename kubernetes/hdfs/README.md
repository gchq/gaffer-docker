HDFS Helm Chart
===============

The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. This Helm Chart can be used to deploy a HDFS instance onto a Kubernetes cluster.

By default, this chart deploys:
* a single name node, configured with 1 x 10GB data volume
* 3 x data nodes, each configured with 2 x 10GB data volumes
* configuration for a replication factor of 3


## Deployment

There are guides for deploying this chart on:
* a local Kubernetes cluster, [using kind (Kubernetes IN Docker)](docs/kind-deployment.md)
* an [AWS EKS cluster](docs/aws-eks-deployment.md)
