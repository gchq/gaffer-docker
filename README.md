Gaffer Docker
================

This repo contains the code needed to run Gaffer using Docker or Kubernetes. 
There are two main sub-folders, 'docker' and 'kubernetes' which contain the project files you need for starting Gaffer using those services.

# Running Gaffer Using Docker

# Running Gaffer Using Kubernetes

# Versioning
Each of our images which is released will be tagged with the version of the software they represent. Every release,
we update the `latest` tag for each image and add a new release which has the corresponding version tag.

If we release Gaffer version 2.1.2, the following images would be uploaded:

* gchq/gaffer:latest
* gchq/gaffer:2
* gchq/gaffer:2.1
* gchq/gaffer:2.1.2
* gchq/gaffer:2.1.2-accumulo-2.0.1

We maintain mutable versions of latest, as well as the major, minor and bugfix versions of Gaffer. For reproducibility
make sure to use the full version in your build metadata. For `gaffer`/`gaffer-rest` images, we also create a tag including the
accumulo version, this allows for compatibility with Accumulo 1.9.3 in our tests. The `-accumulo-1.9.3` tagged images
are not published but can be build locally if required.

The release process is automated by GitHub actions.

# Known Compatible Docker Versions
